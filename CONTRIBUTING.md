# Contributing to `jt-computing`

The `jt-computing` project is mostly a personal project to reimplement things I
am interested and really going down to the details and understanding all of
computing. It is about aesthetic, generic code, as Alexander Stepanov envisioned
it (at least thats the goal).

If you are interested in this or find something useful and want to adjust:
Go ahead, but maybe I don't like it or just don't care and then it will be
rejected! So ask first before you invest a lot of time.
Feel free to fork though!
